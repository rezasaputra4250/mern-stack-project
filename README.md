# MERN Stack Project

This is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This project aims to demonstrate how to set up and integrate the four technologies to create a dynamic and responsive web application.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store application data.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js used to build the backend of the application.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the frontend of the application.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to run the backend server.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-stack-project.git
cd mern-stack-project
```

### 2. Install the backend dependencies:

Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Install the frontend dependencies:

Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend with the following content:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_uri
PORT=5000
```

Replace `your_mongo_database_uri` with the connection string to your MongoDB instance.

### 5. Run the application:

#### Backend:

To run the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

#### Frontend:

To run the frontend React application:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000` and the frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **Authentication**: User authentication using JWT tokens.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is built to be responsive and works across various devices.
- **State Management**: State management using React's context API or Redux (depending on your setup).
- **API Integration**: The frontend makes API calls to the backend using Axios or Fetch.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: Contains all React code and assets.
  - `src/components/`: React components.
  - `src/pages/`: Pages used in the application.
  - `src/utils/`: Utility functions like API requests.

- **Backend**: Contains all server-side code.
  - `controllers/`: Logic for handling requests and responses.
  - `models/`: Mongoose models for interacting with MongoDB.
  - `routes/`: API routes for handling HTTP requests.
